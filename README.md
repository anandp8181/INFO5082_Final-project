We know that every business need customers, as they are the source of revenue. Success of business is directly proportional to its ability to acquire customers, solve their issues , and make more money. But for this to happen, business has to identify the right potential customers. In todayâ€™s world, customers have many options to choose. The business has to understand and plan for what the customers might do in the future. Simply, putting in words, they need to predict customer behavior. This project aims at this point. It uses customer data to analyze and understand how customers behave and react to marketing strategies, observe customer segmentation w.r.t various attributes, and finally predict customer Lifetime value. CLV is a monetary value that represents the amount of revenue a customer will spend on the business over the lifetime of their relationship. Tagging each customer with CLV helps a business focus on those customers who can bring most revenue in future.
